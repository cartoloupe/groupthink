# groupthink
moderates conversations in a group

## stories
1. A and B are having a conversation, they are using groupthink
2. A talks for a minute, then groupthink alerts that the time limit is reached
3. A yields the floor to B, the timer is reset, and B starts talking
4. B uses less than a minute, and indicates that they are done; groupthink yields the floor back to A
5. C walks in
6. A shows C the groupthink id on A's phone, C uses the id to join the conversation
7. D also joins the same way, getting the id from C, who just joined
8. While B is talking, C gestures that they want to talk next; groupthink queues C up
9. D also gestures; groupthink queues D after C
10. When B's time is up, the floor is yielded to C, and then to D
11. A says bye and leaves the group; groupthink now only manages B, C, and D
